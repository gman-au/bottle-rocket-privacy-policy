# Privacy Policy for Bottle Rocket
_Last Updated: December 29, 2025_

### Overview

* G-MAN ("we," "our," or "us") provides the Bottle Rocket mobile application as a tool for users to interface with their own self-hosted infrastructure.

* Our core privacy principle is simple - we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.

### No Data Collection

* We do not collect any information from you when you download, install, or use the app.

* **No Personal Information**: We do not ask for your name, email, or contact details.

* **No Tracking**: There are no trackers, analytics, or advertising SDKs embedded in the app.

* **No Usage Data**: We do not monitor how often you use the app or which features you access.

### Self-Hosted Architecture

* The app is designed to communicate exclusively with a server provided and managed by the user.

* **Data Routing**: Any data processed by the app (such as scanned notes or images) is transmitted directly to the user-specified server address.

* **No Intermediaries**: This data does not pass through our servers at any point.

* **Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for the security and privacy of the self-hosted server you choose to connect to the app.

### Device Permissions
* To provide its core functionality, the app may request the following permissions:
   * **Camera**: used strictly to scan documents or QR codes. The video feed is processed locally on your device, and only the resulting scan is sent to your self-hosted server.
   * **Network/Internet**: Required to transmit data to your self-hosted server.

### Third-Party Services
* The app is distributed via the Google Play Store, which may collect basic device information (such as model and OS version) for "App Health" (crash reports) if you have opted into sharing that data with Google. Please refer to the Google Play Services Privacy Policy for more information.
